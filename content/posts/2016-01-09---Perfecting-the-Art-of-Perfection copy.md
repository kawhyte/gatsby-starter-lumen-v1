What new language should I be learning to find a Dev job? Which is framework/library is best to learn now -React.js vs Angular vs Vue.js vs “who the hell knows”.js. or should I know all of then right now? Backend vs Frontend vs Fullstack? What special thing should I do to get a job at FANG? All these questions make my brain feel like it is in an upcoming UFC heavyweight championship fight coming to you live on Pay-per-view. Then you get into the loop of running after everything that is “new” but you never really finish or learn anything worthwhile.

Don't worry, I've done the same thing a few years ago. I was constantly chasing the new and shiny thing, just to have it fizzle in popularity in a few months. Then I was back a square one. It was frustrating and I also discovered that technique was the best way to get nothing done fast.


What's my secret? Well, it's quite simple, I've discovered that there is more to my Dev life than always looking for the next BIG thing to learn. The truth is that almost all of these new languages/frameworks are built on the software fundamentals that you try to skip. They are variants of the Gand of Four and other patterns that have been around for over 30 years.

**Bite-size tip:** Stop chasing those new items and just focus on the old, dusty, tried and true software development fundamentals. Then, pick a framework (React, Angular, Vue or something else), and see if you can identify the fundamental patterns. 

Kenny out!
