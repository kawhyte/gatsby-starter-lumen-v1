*What new language should I be learning now? Which is framework/library is best to learn now -React.js vs Angular vs Vue.js vs “who the hell knows”.js. or should I know all of then right now? Backend vs Frontend vs Fullstack?*

All these questions make my brain feel like it is in an upcoming UFC heavyweight championship fight coming to you live on Pay-per-view. After a five round fight with your brain with all these question. You then start a Udemy course on Vue.js only to stop after one week because everyone on the internet is talking about React. So, you start a react course on Youtube only to find out that Angular is "better". After a month of this,you start thinking , "I suck at this Software Dev thing. It is just too hard". Welcome my friend, you just entered in to what I call the **"Tutorial death loop"**.  You are  in the loop of running after everything that is “new” but you never really finish or learn anything worthwhile.

Don't worry, I've done the same thing a few years ago. I was constantly chasing the new and shiny thing, just to have it fizzle in popularity in a few months. Then I was back a square one. It was frustrating and I also discovered that technique was the best way to get nothing done fast.

What's my secret? Well, it's quite simple, I've discovered that there is more to my Dev life than always looking for the next BIG thing to learn. The truth is that almost all of these new languages/frameworks are built on the software fundamentals that you try to skip. They are variants of the [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) (GOF) and other [patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) that have been around for over 30 years.

## Bite-size tip
Stop chasing those new items and just focus on the old, dusty, tried and true software development **fundamentals**. Then, pick a framework (React, Angular, Vue or something else), and see if you can identify the fundamental patterns. There is always going to be a new kid on the block. **Don't focus on the language or framework, keep you eyes on the core ideas.**

Kenny out!
